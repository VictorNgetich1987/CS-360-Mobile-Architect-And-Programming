Project Summary and Reflection Of The App.
The Inventory Control App was developed to provide users with an efficient and organized way to manage and track inventory items. The primary goal of the application is to simplify inventory monitoring by allowing users to add, remove, increase, and decrease item quantities while ensuring data accuracy through persistent database storage 

Final project

. By centralizing inventory management, the app helps users prevent stock shortages and maintain better control over available items.

To support these user needs, the app includes key features such as user authentication, a grid-style inventory view, and optional text notifications for low-stock alerts 

Final project

. Layouts were designed and built using Android Studio, focusing on clarity, ease of navigation, and quick access to common actions. The grid layout allows users to efficiently monitor inventory levels and edit items with minimal effort, reinforcing a user-centered UI design approach.

From a development perspective, the app stores all inventory data in a database to ensure changes are saved consistently and reflected in real time 

Final project

. The coding process followed a structured, incremental approach, implementing one feature at a time and testing functionality throughout development. This strategy improved reliability and made it easier to identify and resolve issues early in the process.

The application is compatible with Android 11 and newer devices, ensuring it runs smoothly on modern platforms 

Final project

. Users have the option to enable notifications for low inventory alerts, enhancing the app’s practical value. While the app is not currently monetized, future enhancements may include barcode scanning functionality using the device camera, as well as potential monetization options such as business licensing or in-app advertisements 

Final project

.

One area where I was particularly successful was integrating the database with the user interface so inventory updates are accurately stored and immediately displayed. This component demonstrates my growth in Android development, database usage, and user-focused design, especially considering I began this project with no prior mobile app development experience.
